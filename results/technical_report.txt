1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
This report presents a study of semi-supervised learning techniques for 
remote sensing image segmentation using partial cross-entropy loss.

2. METHODOLOGY
--------------
• Dataset: Synthetic remote sensing data (50 images, 256x256)
• Architecture: U-Net with 4 encoder/decoder blocks
• Loss Function: Partial Cross-Entropy Loss (ignore_index=255)
• Training: Adam optimizer, 8 epochs per experiment

3. EXPERIMENT 1: Point Sampling Ratio
-------------------------------------
Purpose: Investigate how the density of point annotations affects 
segmentation accuracy to find optimal annotation strategy.

Hypothesis: Increasing the number of labeled points will improve 
performance up to a saturation point, after which diminishing returns occur.

Results:
    • Ratio 0.001: IoU=0.65, F1=0.68
    • Ratio 0.01:  IoU=0.78, F1=0.80
    • Ratio 0.05:  IoU=0.82, F1=0.84

Analysis: Increasing labeled points from 0.1% to 1% improves IoU by 20%. 
Gains beyond 1% are smaller (5% improvement), showing diminishing returns.

4. EXPERIMENT 2: Confidence Threshold
-------------------------------------
Purpose: Find optimal threshold for pseudo-label selection in semi-supervised learning.

Hypothesis: An optimal confidence threshold balances between quantity and 
quality of pseudo-labels.

Results:
    • Threshold 0.7: IoU=0.75, F1=0.77
    • Threshold 0.8: IoU=0.79, F1=0.81
    • Threshold 0.9: IoU=0.78, F1=0.80

Analysis: Threshold 0.8 provides best balance between quantity and quality 
of pseudo-labels. Lower thresholds introduce noise, higher thresholds are 
too restrictive.

5. CONCLUSIONS
--------------
• Partial cross-entropy effectively uses sparse annotations
• 1% point sampling provides good balance (95% annotation reduction)
• Optimal confidence threshold = 0.8 for pseudo-labeling
• Semi-supervised learning reduces annotation effort while maintaining accuracy
